Kundli Generator (Vedic Astrology Birth Chart)
This repository helps generate a Kundli (birth chart) using Vedic astrology. The Kundli is an astrological chart that maps the positions of the planets and other celestial bodies at the time of a person's birth. It is a key tool for understanding personality, life path, and various aspects of a person's destiny according to Vedic astrology.

Prerequisites
To generate an accurate Kundli, the following details are required:

Date of Birth: Day, Month, Year
Time of Birth: Exact time (in hours, minutes, AM/PM or in 24-hour format)
Place of Birth: City, State, Country (to determine the longitude and latitude for accurate positioning)
These details help calculate the exact position of planets in the zodiac signs and their placement in the 12 houses of the horoscope.

The Positions of Planets in the zodiac signs (e.g., Sun in Capricorn, Moon in Taurus).
The Dasha periods, or planetary periods, showing when different planetary influences are most prominent in a person’s life.

Understanding the Key Components of the Kundli
Ascendant (Lagna): The zodiac sign that was rising on the eastern horizon at the time of birth. This sets the foundation of your birth chart and is associated with your outer personality.
Sun, Moon, and Ascendant: The positions of the Sun (soul and ego), Moon (mind and emotions), and Ascendant (outer self) are key to understanding your core identity.
Planets: Each planet has specific influences, such as Mars (energy), Venus (love), Jupiter (wisdom), and Saturn (discipline).
Houses: The chart is divided into 12 houses, each representing different life areas such as career, relationships, and health.
Dasha System: In Vedic astrology, the Dasha system indicates the influence of planetary periods throughout life.
Advanced Features
Nakshatras: These are lunar constellations that further define the positions of the Moon and planets.
Yogas: Special planetary combinations that provide insight into the person’s destiny, including wealth, career, and overall fortune.

FAQ
Why is the exact time of birth important?
The time of birth determines the position of the Ascendant (Lagna) and the placement of planets in the houses of the birth chart. Small changes in time can shift the chart and its interpretation significantly.

Can I generate a Kundli without the exact time of birth?
While the chart can still be generated, it will be less accurate without the exact time of birth, as the Ascendant and the planetary positions in the houses may be off by several degrees.

Can I use this Kundli for marriage or career predictions?
Yes, Vedic astrology includes matchmaking and career predictions based on planetary positions and Dasha periods. However, for detailed and accurate predictions, consult a professional astrologer.
